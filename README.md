# Mandelbrot Fractal Visualization with Raylib

This project is a simple implementation of the Mandelbrot fractal using the Raylib library in C.
The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that exhibits intricate and infinitely complex boundary structures.

## Features

- Visualizes the Mandelbrot fractal in a window.
- Allows zooming to explore different parts of the fractal.

## Requirements

- Raylib library
- C compiler (e.g., GCC or clang)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FrexG/Mandelbrot-Fractal.git
    ```

2. Install Raylib:
    Follow the instructions on the Raylib website.

3. Compile the project:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

## Usage

Run the compiled executable:
```sh
./mandelbrot
```
